Title: Mapping the Aging Brain: MRI-Based Analysis of Cognitive and Structural Changes in Dementia

A paragraph to introduce your topic, and why it is important/interesting?

Our project explores how the human brain changes with age and how these changes relate to memory, thinking ability, and diseases like Alzheimer’s. Using the OASIS MRI dataset, we look at patterns in brain volume, cognitive scores, and other factors such as education and gender across different age groups. This topic is important because understanding how the brain ages can help scientists and doctors find ways to detect early signs of decline and slow down diseases that affect memory. It is also interesting because it shows how data can reveal the story of the aging brain visually and interactively.
